# **Reproducible Research Project 1**

# **Introduction**

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal
movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit , Nike
Fuelband , or Jawbone Up . These type of devices are part of the
“quantified self” movement – a group of enthusiasts who take
measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find
patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these
data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain
and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing
and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and
include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:

Dataset: Activity monitoring data [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are
coded as NA NA)

date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format

interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was
taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there
are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

## ***Assignment***

This assignment will be described in multiple parts. You will need to
write a report that answers the questions detailed below. Ultimately,
you will need to complete the entire assignment in a single R markdown
document that can be processed by knitr and be transformed into an HTML
file.

Throughout your report make sure you always include the code that you
used to generate the output you present. When writing code chunks in the
R markdown document, always use echo = TRUE echo = TRUE so that someone
else will be able to read the code. This assignment will be evaluated
via peer assessment so it is essential that your peer evaluators be able
to review the code for your analysis.

For the plotting aspects of this assignment, feel free to use any
plotting system in R (i.e., base, lattice, ggplot2)

Fork/clone the GitHub repository created for this assignment . You will
submit this assignment by pushing your completed files into your forked
repository on GitHub. The assignment submission will consist of the URL
to your GitHub repository and the SHA-1 commit ID for your repository
state.

NOTE: The GitHub repository also contains the dataset for the assignment
so you do not have to download the data separately.

Loading and preprocessing the data Show any code that is needed to

Load the data (i.e. read.csv() read.csv())

Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for
your analysis

-   What is mean total number of steps taken per day? For this part of
    the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

-   Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

-   If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a
    barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of
    the total number of steps taken each day

-   Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of
    steps taken per day

-   What is the average daily activity pattern? Make a time series plot
    (i.e. type = “l” type = “l”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and
    the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

-   Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the
    dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

-   Imputing missing values Note that there are a number of
    days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA NA). The
    presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations
    or summaries of the data.

-   Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the
    dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NA NAs)

-   Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the
    dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For
    example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for
    that 5-minute interval, etc.

-   Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with
    the missing data filled in.

-   Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and
    Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken
    per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first
    part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data
    on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

-   Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and
    weekends? For this part the weekdays() weekdays() function may be of
    some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values
    for this part.

    -   Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels –
        “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a
        weekday or weekend day.

    -   Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”
        type = “l”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average
        number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or
        weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub
        repository to see an example of what this plot should look like
        using simulated data.

# Assignment answers: Loading and preprocessing the data

### Load the data

`activity_data <- read.csv("activity.csv")`

### Check the structure of the data for integrity

`str(activity_data)`
